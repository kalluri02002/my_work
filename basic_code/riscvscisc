| Feature            | RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) | CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Instruction Set** | Small, simple instructions | Large, complex instructions |
| **Execution Speed** | Faster, as instructions take one or few clock cycles | Slower, as complex instructions take multiple cycles |
| **Instruction Length** | Fixed and uniform | Variable |
| **Memory Usage** | More instructions, but simpler and use less memory | Fewer instructions, but complex ones take more memory |
| **Registers** | More registers, reducing memory access | Fewer registers, relying on memory more often |
| **Microcode Usage** | Hardwired control (no microcode) | Uses microcode for complex instruction decoding |
| **Code Size** | Larger due to more instructions | Smaller as fewer, more powerful instructions are used |
| **Pipelining** | Easier to implement | Difficult due to variable-length instructions |
| **Power Consumption** | Lower | Higher |
| **Example Architectures** | ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, RISC-V | x86, Intel 8086, Motorola 68000 |
