1.what is use of pointer ?
  1.which stores the address of anther variable
  2.Pointers are used to allocate memory dynamically using functions like malloc(), calloc(), and free().
  3. allowing function callbacks.
  4.Pointers help in efficient structure handling, especially when dealing with linked lists and trees.
  5.Passing Arguments by Reference and string manipulation.

Here is the difference between C and Embedded C:

Feature	C Language	Embedded C
Definition	A general-purpose programming language used for software development.	A specialized version of C designed for programming embedded systems.
Target System	Used for desktops, servers, and application software.	Used for microcontrollers, microprocessors, and embedded devices.
Standard Libraries	Uses standard libraries like <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>.	Uses hardware-specific libraries like <reg51.h> for microcontroller registers.
Memory Management	Uses dynamic memory allocation (e.g., malloc, free).	Limited or no dynamic memory allocation due to constrained resources.
OS Dependency	Runs on an operating system like Windows, Linux, etc.	Runs without an OS, directly on hardware.
I/O Operations	Uses standard input/output functions like printf(), scanf().	Uses direct register access or GPIO functions for hardware interaction.
Optimization	Focuses on performance and readability.	Optimized for speed, memory efficiency, and power consumption.
Application	Used in software development, data structures, algorithms, etc.	Used in embedded systems like IoT devices, automotive systems, and industrial machines.
Code Execution	Runs on processors with high processing power.	Runs on microcontrollers with limited processing power.
 
 3 .Use of #include in C and Embedded C
The #include directive in C and Embedded C is used to include header files in a program. It allows the compiler to use functions, macros, and constants defined in external files.
